Last Updates:

v3.3.0 - CHR.
    - Updated to saving to .h5 and .nc files (no pickle any longer)
    - implemented mfit module

v3.1.0 - OSC:
    - fixed the average_data function, at the moment it works only for data_table
    
v3.0.0. -CHR:
  - Updated to data_table and data_grid structure

v2.6.1 - OSC:
    - corrected the amplitude of the lorentzian_fit function
    
v2.6.0 - OSC:
    - reduced data_complex mem usage, dB and phase are now functions, check the
    help of these functions for more info
    - update the data module conversion function to adapt to the new
    data_complex

v2.5.0 - CHR:
  - Automatically sort data during upgrade for data_line
  - Added function to plot multiple datamodules in one figure dm.plot_multiple
  
v2.4.1 - CHR:
  - Removed Resize Tool in bokeh (depreciated)
  
v2.4.0 - CHR:
  - Added data_IQ class

v2.3.7 - OSC:
    - re-launching the exception when a fit failes (inside data_line.fit() function), one has to have the possibility to handle exceptions. 
    NOTE: This exception handling was added and it is not written in the version.

v2.3.6 - Michael
 - Added extract_max_lorentzianfit_y to data_surface

 - Some minor improvements and bugfixes

v2.3.3 - CHR:
  - Adapted OSC load folder function to datamodule.

v2.3.2 - OSC:
    - when saving with the 'save' function, if the file exists it will copy the
    old file in the "duplicates" folder and will append a number to it. The new
    file will be saved in the current folder with the given name. In this way
    if a measurement didn't give the correct result, one can measure it again
    using the same name, all the discarded measurements will accumulate in the
    "duplicates" folder.

  (check the help function for details)
- imshow now plots correctly (it was flipped before)
- The load_datamodule function will now try as default to upgrade an opened
  datamodule, it is possible to toggle this option

v1.5.2 - CHR:
- dm.fit:
  added possibility to change fit function parameters for scipys
  optimize fitfunction

v1.5.1 - OSC:
    - moved the version number inside the class constructor
    - printed a conversion note, but it will work only from now on (see above)

    - names measurements 'measurement' by default
    
v1.3.0 - Oscar:
- re-organized the classes, now every datamodule class inherit a base class

v1.2.6 - DAZ:
- minor updates in complex datamodule for new bokeh plotting engine
prior pyplot is still available, set plot_engine = 'pyplot' when calling circle fit

v1.2.5 - DAZ:
- minor modifications in complex datamodule

v1.2.4 - DAZ:
- minor modifications in complex datamodule

v1.2.3 - OSC + DAZ

- when saving it is not necessary to specify the .dm extension
- it is possible to load the data when creating a new data module
- added error bars plotting as default
- removed the functions load and save (they will be inserted in the UtilitiesLib eventually), the function save_OBJ is now renamed save

v1.1.2 - Oscar:
- added the offset option in the dm.nice_plot()
- fixed the data_3d print options to make it compatible with nice_plot()

v1.1.1
- added option to set initial fr for circle fit in dm_cplx


v1.1.0
- fixed some problem with the select function in data_2d
- modified the function pcolormesh that was not working before in data_3d
- added the functions extrapolate_x, extrapolate_y , extrapolate_min_x, extrapolate_min_y, extrapolate_max_x, exptrapolate_max_y in data_3d
- added the function copy() in each data module, that returns a copy of it


- in the library now we have nice_plot function that can be called BEFORE plotting data, it will make the plot standard and nicer
- the functions data_2d.plot and data_3d.contourf have been slightly modified
- the functions replot and nice_plot have been removed from data_2d
- added the functions to stack data along the x-axis or y-axis for data_2d and data_3d
- added the function to make data averaging for data_2d and data_3d
- add the function to combine data, for example if we decide to put more points in a plot, we can inglobe the new data in the old one
